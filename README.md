Overview 
For this exercise, we'll restructure the IMDB site (Links to an external site.).  Inspecting their HTML, their site is not very semantically friendly.   

Learning Objectives 
Use as many tags as necessary to avoid duplication of unnecessary tags 
Use tags to convey function and form. 
Requirements
Focus on the HTML and restructure IMDB's site (Links to an external site.) to use semantic HTML. 
Justify each tag with an inline comment describing why you have chosen that particular tag/element. 
Paste a link or your raw HTML within this document to submit it for grading.






<!-- Why should we structure HTML semantically for something like a login form?  -->
Semantic HTML reinforces meaning, so using it in something like a login form gives clear direction as to what information is required at each tag or element. 

<!-- What are some benefits of everyone using similar semantic HTML?  -->
Semantic HTML provides better accessibility, searchability and readability.

<!-- What are some disadvantages?  -->
If everyone is using the same semantic markup, we can lose creativity. We can also lose meaning over time as words can change meaning, or previous definitions were illdefined and something better could take its place. 

Deliverables:
Provide a link to your Github page. Answer the questions in a readme.txt file.
